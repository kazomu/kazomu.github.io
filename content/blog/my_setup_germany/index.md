title: Things I wish I knew before coming to Germany

**Work in progress**

Things I wish I knew
1. The procedure to get a phone number (And putting the slightly wrong address can be very hard to fix!)
2. Register with insurance on day 1
3. How buses and trains are booked (Can you take any local train in the route?)
4. Maybe one of my employers/colleagues/admins can help me find a place (I didn't need it personally because I got lucky, but it would have really been helpful if I didn't).
5. Getting printouts on a Saturday isn't easy, but using your office printer might be easier to access. The offices are supposed to be accessible on all days including weekends even if no one is guarding it!
6. Tip 10% at restaurants with a waiter, don't tip at places without a waiter (e.g., bakery).

Things I am glad I knew
1. Get the Anmeldung appointment before I came.
2. Pick the tax ID a week after the Anmeldung is done.
3. Pick the social security number a few days after it was ready.

Things I am glad I did, but are not necessary
1. Learnt some German. I was already nearly A1 proficiency before I came. It wasn't enough, but it still helped quite a bit.
2. Be very careful and respectful about following the norms of Germany. It was a new country, so I researched as much as I could. I also didn't hesitate to ask when I was confused about what the right way is.

Some other useful information
1. LÃ¼ften system (Essential in winters as well!)
2. Trash segregation system (TODO!)
3. Cycling rules in Germany like way of the right (TODO!)
4. Use your bank to just get a giro card which will work only locally. For functionality of a credit card, you can get something like wise (Please do your own research whether wise is the right choice. I do not wish to advertise anything here!)
