**Work in progress**

This post was inspired from when a friend from Ireland expressed interest in visiting India.

I visited Delhi and my rather-small hometown in Rajasthan in December. What took me most by surprise was the pollution. It is a lot more than what it used to be. The crowd was also more challenging than in Germany. I was very briefly in queues, but enough to feel people squeezing onto me and also learn why they do it (because when I left some room, and someone would cut ahead!).

Outside of the pollution and the queueing behavior, people were still nice. I also had a much better experience at shops than I usually do in Germany. It was an amazing reminder of the quality of service in India when my friend was able to order an extremely customized vegetable juice for just 80 rupees. This juice had more vegetables than I have had at restaurants in Germany in the whole year combined.

After Delhi and Rajasthan, I visited Bangalore. Being a very big city with a lot of people, I expected Bangalore to be just as polluted as the previous cities I visited but it wasn't. The AQI is still higher than it is probably anywhere in Germany, but I really didn't feel it. I also found the crowd to be gentler. Thus, for a short first trip to India, I will recommend visiting a city like Bangalore. Some other nice things about Bangalore - 

- It still has some cool forts and museums.
- There are more cities and mountains worth visiting nearby.
- The city is very accessible with cabs.

Of course, as you gain experience you should visit other cities (mentioned below). **TODO - Add more about perks of Bangalore**

Since I stayed with my family in Bangalore, I could get a reminder of how the different the life of an average person is. E.g., they had cooks, everything (including butter) delivered to them in 15 minutes, and went over the city on cab rides.

On my return-flight to Germany, I was lucky to sit next to two siblings who just did a two month trip. They had a great time in India and here are the things I learnt from them

- One of them had some experience doing volunteer work in India, and the other had experience with other Asian countries like Vietnam. They felt that this experience helped them to navigate through India.
- They visited Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, Kolkata in West Bengal, Ooty in Karnataka, some cities in Kerela. They loved all of these cities.
- They did have to defend themselves against some aggressive folks, but they managed.
- They also had to defend themselves against folks trying to scam them, but that was lesser in some cities than in others.
