**Work in progress!**
[Bakuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuman) is one of my favorite anime, and I have always wanted to write about it. Someday, I hope I will write this post.

### Strengths

- Display of passion and dedication
- Significance of healthy competition, rivalry and good mentorship
	- Healthy mentorship - Hattori (undoubtedly), while also showing an issue with bad mentorship (Miura) 
- Showcasing different versions of artists - some who create art by strategizing to create something new, and others who have art flowing through them.
	- Nizuma Eji - For him, he doesn't have to think about his characters and story. They just move on their own.
	- Ashirogi Muto - Think about every step of the story. Think about how it will be perceived. Think about rankings, strategize to create something new.
	- Hiramaru - Writes only to be able to have to never write again. In fact, he is forced to write. Still, he creates some of the most amazing works.
	- Yuriko Aoki - There are some things that she wants to convey through her art. For her, the challenge is to convey in a way that the audience can enjoy it.
	- Aiko Iwase - She is pretty successful as a novelist. She is now writing manga because... Uh... the guy she liked because he did better than her in school, writes manga... The message of this one wasn't entirely clear to me.
	- Shinta Fukuda - Another hard worker. One thing that sets him apart is his desire to change the manga industry, although that could have been developed more.
- Insight into how manga is created
- Awesome opening song (blue bird)
- Interesting balance of lovers who are also dedicated to their career goals
- Tries to tackle handling relationships ('love life') while having dedicated yourself to art. 

## Weaknesses

- Romanticism of "death by overworking"
- Representation and place of female characters is extremely backward, to say the least. The protagonist's father said something like "A woman cannot understand the goals of a man." when talking about the protagonist's career goals. That was really bad... Sadly, many anime suffer from it. Characters can be noble, but still glorified perverts (e.g., Jiraiya from Naruto). Interestingly, Gintama, where none of the characters try to be noble, seems to be an anime where I see women being respectfully respected.

## Other things that I enjoyed

- The action without any fighting. One reviewer on myanimelist puts it like this - 'The anime talks about how a good anime has swords, and so does this one - the swords are their pens.'
- The best opening ever! (TODO - Embed youtube video here?) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMRheOXO_w

TODO - Add pictures? Links to music?
